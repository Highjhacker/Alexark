## How to use it
I have no Alexa so I can't document on how to use it currently, but I can document
on how to use it with [echosim](https://echosim.io/).

You just have to go on the [echosim website](https://echosim.io/), allow it to use
your microphone. Then you can ask things like "Alexa, ask Ark price", "Alexa, open Ark price".

## Current Features
- Can get the price from CoinMarketCap.

## TODOS
- [ ] Just output the two first decimals maybe ?
- [ ] Allow to specify a currency for converting the price of Ark (like euro, chf, ...)
- [ ] ...
